In order to contact a Dux file server, you will need some credentials.

Right now, Dux only supports a file server backed by Google Cloud Storage. To authenticate yourself, create a service account for your cloud datastore and then set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the json file you downloaded (the name of your file will be different):

> export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=mygoogleauth.json
