Testing dux requires us to build a project, and then repeat that build on another machine.

We use Travis for continuous integration tests. The CI tests (which are all in this folder) should never be broken.

Each test is a pair of shell scripts (e.g. smoke.sh and smoke_config.sh) and a directory (for the smoke test, /shell).
The shell script without _config is the actual version; the _config file generates the expected output for the test.
The two scripts are mostly identical, but the _config file uses the --saveconfig (-a) option of dux to also save the
config file to the GCS bucket where the dependencies are saved. You can then retrieve it and commit it to source control
in the directory of the test project. The non-_config version assumes the presence of an "expected.dux" file, which it
compares the result of running dux to using diff.
