So, you want to add a Maven dependency to Dux? Dux uses rules_maven (https://github.com/pubref/rules_maven) for adding Maven dependencies. Unfortunately, its documentation is garbage.

Here are concrete steps to add a Maven dependency to dux.

1. Create a new rule in the WORKSPACE file that looks like this:

maven_repository(
  name = "jna_platform",
  deps = [
    'net.java.dev.jna:jna-platform:4.5.1',
  ],
)

load("@jna_platform//:rules.bzl", "jna_platform_compile")
jna_platform_compile()

There are a few holes to fill in here. Replace "net.java.dev.jna" with the Maven repo you're using. Replace "jna_platform" with the artifact name, and "4.5.1" with the artifact version you want.

2. Add to the list of dependencies in the BUILD file:

"@jna_platform//:compile",

again, replace "jna_platform" with your artifact name.

3. Run "bazel build //:dux". This should generate a new version of the maven_repository rule in "hermetic" form. Copy that into the WORKSPACE file, replacing the other maven_repository rule you wrote in step 1.

4. You're done. Confirm this worked by running "bazel build //:dux" again.
